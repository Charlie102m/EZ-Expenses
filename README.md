# EZ Expenses

Milage and expenses tracking app for field based business users. Mobile first design, allowing quick and simple logging of business trips and purchases. Leverages Google APIâ€™s to search for destinations, calculate optimal route, distance and time.

I am happy to collaborate should a mobile developer wish to build a native front-end to this. Current front-end is built on vue.js for web.

Feel free to submit a pull request or use the API in your own projects.

Please note if this API is misused I shall remove it from public use.

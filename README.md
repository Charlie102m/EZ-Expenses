# The Expenses App

Mobile friendly web app for logging & claiming for business milage and expenses.

My previous role entailed travelling 30,000 + business miles per year which added up to a significant amount of time completing milage claims. With my business's cumbersome spreadsheet template and searching google maps to calculate the distance, too much time was being spent on completing these claims.

To streamline this process, I created EZ-expenses to allow myself and colleagues to log their work trips from their mobile in seconds, utilising Google's autocomplete and directions api's.

Once a user has enough trips logged, they can then generate the milage claim spreadsheet to download and submit in seconds.
